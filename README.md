This is a NextJS + ExpressJS + MongoDB application.

# Project description

The purpose of the project is to develop a web application to make the process of getting a puppy easier for new dog owners.

The end product will be a platform where dog owners can take quizzes to learn more about having a puppy, as well as the opportunity to follow their dog's development by writing updates. The dog owner should also receive tips based on his dog's age when it may be time to start attending a puppy course and how much food the puppy should receive based on breed and age.

The platform will also have a forum where you can ask questions to other dog owners who may have been in the same situation before.
