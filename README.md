# Platform for new dog owners

The purpose of the project is to develop an application to make it easier for new dog owners with their puppy.

The end product will be a platform where dog owners can take quizzes to learn more about having a puppy, as well as the opportunity to follow their dog's development by writing updates and posting pictures.

The dog owner will also receive tips based on the dog's age, and for example when it may be a good time to start attending a puppy course and how much food the puppy should receive based on breed and age.

The platform will also have a forum where dog owners can ask questions to other owners who may have been in a similar situation with their dog.
